Please implement the complete functionality demonstrated in the `@src/components/checkbox.tsx` and `@src/demo/checkbox.tsx` file. Write the corresponding Rust code in `@src/components/checkbox.rs` and `@src/demo/checkbox.rs` file. You can use the existing components in `@src/components` directory. After that, integrate this new component into the routing system by adding it to the `@src/app.rs` file.
Ensure that the new component is fully functional and adheres to the existing coding standards and patterns used in the project.
When writing the code, you must refer to the usage patterns of components in the `@src/components` directory to ensure consistency and proper functionality. Additionally, adhere strictly to the guidelines and instructions provided in the `@scripts/examples.txt` and `@scripts/instructions.txt` files.
